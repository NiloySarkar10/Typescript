# How to setup the Node-Express with TS project

1. Install typescript on the system
2. Clone the repo
3. Run npm install to install all the dependencies
4. For **development** run _tsc -w_ to keep building your ts files

## NOTE:
1. The tsconfig will read files in /src folder to build TS files to JS, so in case any new files that needs to be added, kindly ensure that those new files are put under/under a folder in /src folder.
2. All the build files will be present in /dist folder, from where we will get the final files for deployment.
